# Meteor React Native Starter

This is the final code repo for our workshop "Meteor and React Native" @ Meteor Impact 2022.
After post-editing it resulted in a complete starter repo. 🤩

## About

Meteor and React Native are not integrated with each other by default.
However, there are great packages out there, that help us to make them integrate.
The best is, it's actually not that difficult!

This starter brings the most basic integration for a Meteor project as a backend for your react native app.
Just follow the instructions in this readme to get startet immediately.

## Installation

You need to have Meteor installed on your system.
Follow the Meteor installation instructions on [the Meteor website](https://meteor.com).

### Create a new project from this template repo

This repo is a template repo so you can create your own project from it or directly clone it.

If you want to clone it directly, you can do it via

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:jankapunkt/meteor-react-native-starter.git
```

### Install and run the Meteor backend (headless)

```bash
$ cd backend
$ meteor npm install
$ meteor npm run start
```

The backend will install and start. If everything went fine, you should see the following message:

```bash
=> App running at: http://localhost:8000/
```

### Alternate backend (with UI)

With thanks to [@fredmaiaarantes](https://github.com/fredmaiaarantes), we have transplanted a Meteor 3.1 "To do" app that shares data with the React Native mobile app.

![Task Form](fm-backend/README-Assets/task_example.png)

You can see how the UI updates instantly between the mobile app and the browser

```bash
$ cd fm-backend
$ meteor npm install
$ meteor npm run start
```

## Install and run the mobile app

Open a **new terminal** in order to install and run the app.
Starting from the project root, do the following:

```bash
$ cd app
$ meteor npm install
$ meteor npm run start
```

The console may prompt you to install expo-cli. If so, agree and continue.
If it does not ask you to install expo and the app fails to build, please manually install expo-cli via:

```bash
$ meteor npm install -g expo-cli
```

### Connect your mobile app to the backend

Connecting your app to the backend a bit more difficult, since you need to get your **local network ip**
in order to make the RN app connect. The Meteor-typical `localhost` will not work here.

First, get your local ip via

| os      | command        |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Linux   | `ip addr show` |
| MaxOs   | `ifconfig`     |
| Windows | `ipconfig`     |

Then replace the pattern `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` with the local ip from your network in `app/config.json`.

Finally, run your app via

```bash
$ cd app && meteor npm run start
```

After running, check the `app/.expo/settings.json` file and make sure it looks like the following:

```json
{
  "hostType": "lan",
  "lanType": "ip",
  "dev": true,
  "minify": false,
  "urlRandomness": "mc-y7b",
  "https": false,
  "scheme": null,
  "devClient": false
}
```

Now you should be good to go to continue your development!

## Install Expo Go on your development device

With the "Expo Go" app you are able to build your dev builds without further configuration or emulators.
You can also build cross-platform and test both Android and iOs without the need for Android SDK or XCode,
Expo covers all that for you.

If you still prefer an emulator, please install them on your own behalf.

## Run the tests

This project comes with a builtin test-stack for backend and app!

The backend uses

- `meteortesting:mocha` as test runner
- `chai` as assertion lib
- `sinon` for stubs
- `hwillson:stub-collections` for stubbing MongoDB collections
- `lmieulet:meteor-coverage` for coverage
- `standardx` with some teaks as linter (basically eslint)

The app uses

- `jest` as test runner and assertion lib
- `standardx` with some teaks as linter (basically eslint)

## API Docs

This repo uses jsDoc to generate API docs for backend and app.
You can find the current API docs in the [docs folder](docs).

To generate docs you can use the respective npm scripts in backend and app.
